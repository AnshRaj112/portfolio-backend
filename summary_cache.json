He was rejected from Scaler in 2023 and watching the kids build startups, write code, and solve problems while he's stuck learning outdated engineering concepts lit a fire of regret. His college is teaching irrelevant things and giving him academic d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, so he's teaching himself what he needs to know. Even though he didn't get in, and despite the broken system he's working in, he's determined to keep learning, building, and maybe even surpass those who had it easier. Ultimately, he doesn't care about getting perfect grades to look good on paper because he's focused on real skills.",
